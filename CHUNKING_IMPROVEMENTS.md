# Audio Chunking Improvements for Whisper Training

## Summary

This document summarizes the improvements made to handle Whisper's 30-second audio chunk limitation in the MorseWhisper training pipeline.

## Problem Statement

Whisper is designed to process audio in fixed 30-second windows (480,000 samples at 16kHz). The original implementation had several issues:

1. **No chunking support**: Audio longer than 30 seconds was fed directly to the model
2. **No padding strategy**: Short audio wasn't properly padded
3. **No transcript alignment**: When chunking audio, transcripts weren't aligned with chunks
4. **Limited evaluation**: No analysis of performance on different audio lengths

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Audio Chunking Module (`src/audio_chunking.py`)

Created a comprehensive audio chunking system with:

- **WhisperAudioChunker** class that handles:
  - Automatic chunking of audio > 30 seconds
  - Configurable overlap between chunks (default 2 seconds)
  - Automatic padding for audio < 30 seconds
  - Transcript alignment with chunks
  - Prediction merging for overlapping chunks

- **Three chunking strategies**:
  - `sequential`: Non-overlapping chunks
  - `sliding`: Overlapping chunks (recommended)
  - `random`: Random sampling for augmentation

### 2. Updated Trainer (`training/fine_tune.py`)

- **MorseWhisperDataset** now handles chunking:
  - Pre-computes chunk metadata for efficiency
  - Creates multiple training samples from long audio
  - Aligns transcripts with each chunk
  - Tracks padding information

- **New command-line arguments**:
  - `--chunk_strategy`: Choose chunking strategy
  - Saves chunking configuration with model

### 3. Enhanced Evaluator (`training/evaluate_model.py`)

- **Chunking-aware evaluation**:
  - Processes long audio in chunks
  - Merges predictions from overlapping chunks
  - Removes duplicate words at boundaries

- **New analysis features**:
  - Separate metrics for chunked vs non-chunked audio
  - WER analysis by audio duration
  - Visual comparison plots
  - Chunking statistics in reports

- **New command-line arguments**:
  - `--no_chunking`: Disable chunking for comparison

### 4. Improved Dataset Builder (`src/dataset_builder.py`)

- **Duration-aware generation**:
  - Configurable duration distribution
  - Generates varied length samples (5-120 seconds)
  - Tracks duration categories

- **Better split creation**:
  - Stratified splits by duration
  - Ensures balanced duration distribution
  - Duration statistics for each split

### 5. Test Suite (`test_chunking.py`)

Comprehensive test suite that validates:
- Short audio padding
- Long audio chunking
- Transcript alignment
- Chunk merging
- Different strategies
- Edge cases

## Usage Examples

### Training with Chunking

```bash
# Train with sliding window chunking (recommended)
python training/fine_tune.py \
    --data_dir data/processed \
    --output_dir models/whisper-morse-chunked \
    --model_name openai/whisper-small \
    --chunk_strategy sliding \
    --batch_size 8 \
    --num_epochs 10
```

### Evaluation with Chunking

```bash
# Evaluate with chunking enabled
python training/evaluate_model.py \
    --model_path models/whisper-morse-chunked \
    --data_dir data/processed \
    --split test \
    --output_dir evaluation_results

# Compare without chunking
python training/evaluate_model.py \
    --model_path models/whisper-morse-chunked \
    --data_dir data/processed \
    --split test \
    --output_dir evaluation_results_no_chunk \
    --no_chunking
```

### Dataset Generation with Duration Control

```bash
# Generate dataset with varied durations
python src/dataset_builder.py \
    --num_samples 5000 \
    --output_dir data/processed \
    --max_duration 120.0
```

### Testing the Implementation

```bash
# Run chunking tests
python test_chunking.py
```

## Key Benefits

1. **Proper handling of long audio**: No more truncation or errors
2. **Better training coverage**: Overlapping chunks improve boundary learning
3. **Flexible strategies**: Choose based on your needs
4. **Performance insights**: Understand how duration affects accuracy
5. **Memory efficient**: On-the-fly chunking saves memory
6. **Backwards compatible**: Can disable chunking for comparison

## Performance Considerations

- **Training time**: Increases with number of chunks
- **Memory usage**: Reduced by on-the-fly processing
- **Accuracy**: Generally improves with overlapping chunks
- **Inference time**: Longer for chunked audio

## Future Improvements

1. Smart chunking at silence boundaries
2. Dynamic overlap based on content
3. Confidence-weighted merging
4. Multi-scale processing for very long audio
5. Streaming inference support
